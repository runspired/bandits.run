We aim for 4-6 miles on the trails in Redwood, Sibley, and Joaquin Miller with new routes each week to see all the lovely trails in our backyard (within the limits of an evening trail run). Afterwards we hangout and eat snacks.</p>\n<p>There are usually a few pace groups but if you’re unfamiliar with the area we recommend you download the route beforehand and since it’s getting dark earlier please bring a headlamp!</p>\n<p>“We sometimes run up stream”</p>\n"
