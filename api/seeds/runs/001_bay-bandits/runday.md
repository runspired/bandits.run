# RUNDAY - Monday Trail Run

RUNDAY is our signature **Monday evening trail run** at Redwood Regional Park, designed to kick off your week with energy and community.

## About This Run

Every Monday, rain or shine, we gather at Skyline Gate for an evening of trail running through the beautiful redwoods. This run has been a Bay Bandits tradition since the beginning!

### What Makes RUNDAY Special

- **Three pace options** to fit everyone's goals
