Salmon Run Club started in Summer 2021 as a followup to the Salomon Run Club and meets every Tuesday at 6:30pm at Skyline Gate Staging Area. We aim for 4-6 miles on the trails in Redwood, Sibley, and Joaquin Miller with new routes each week to see all the lovely trails in our backyard (within the limits of an evening trail run). Afterwards we hangout and eat snacks.

There are usually a few pace groups but if you're unfamiliar with the area we recommend you download the route beforehand and since it's getting dark earlier please bring a headlamp!
