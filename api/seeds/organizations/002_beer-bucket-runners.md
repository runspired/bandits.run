The Beer Bucket Run (BBR) is a weekly trail run in the San Francisco Bay Area (East Bay, primarily).

Our runs are always on trails and typically 12-14 miles. Runners of all ages and paces are 100 percent welcome and there is also always a shorter route. We recommend saving the route ahead of time.

BBR is a great way to explore the amazing East Bay trails with a friendly group of runners. We meet every Sunday at 8-9 AM. The location changes each week, and we occasionally travel to other exotic locales (like Marin or the Sierra Foothills) when circumstances permit.
